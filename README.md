# Boimela-Project-CSE327
In order to avoid all the chaos associated with navigating and visiting the boimela and make peopleâ€™s lives easier, we are introducing the boimela web application. This is a project work undertaken in context of both customers and stall owners. We have tried to design the application in such a way that the user interface is simple and further expansion is possible.
